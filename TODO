add detection log
add error log
add capture device specific initialization routines (ie. UTV007 weird behaviour with OpenCV before calling mplayer tv:// -tv device=/dev/video0)

post-detection:
	photometry

new multiprocessing:
	capture keeps own process (high priorty)
	spawn new process for each new 256 frame block (medium priorty):
		do both compression and fireball extraction successively, in same process
	detection runs on available cores, pausing on high load (low priorty)

improve logging (add messages that level more logging levels and not only debug level)
clean ALL docstrings
add module docstrings and docopt argument parser to all modules that are called from terminal
generate doc page

cleaning daemon:
	moves all processed compressed images to backup storage
	clean compressed images without detection after X time
	clean compressed images with detection when on low storage

things to resolve before 1.0 release:
	cleaning code for multiplatform use (ie. os.sep, abstracting away hardware interface layer)
	Linux daemon for autostarting capture & processing runs
	.deb installer & storing everything on usual locations (/var/log, /usr/local/bin, /opt...)
	Windows daemon (maybe copy CAMS approach?)
	Windows installer & storing everything in usual Win dirs (C:/Program Files/...)
