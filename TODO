High priority:
--------------

- Astrometry - add calculating alt/az in the epoch of date and write to FTPdetectinfo

- Astrometry - automatic recalibration if the camera is moved and the offset is larger than the search radius

- Photometry - estimate vignetting from star movements across the FOV

- Solve logger picking so the code can run on Windows

- Calculate fireball centroids and put them to a separate FTPdetectinfo file

- Python 3 compatibility
	- convert all weave code to cython

- Document server uploading



Low priority:
----------------

- Rolling shutter correction

- Manual reduction tool
	- load a list of FF files
	- load a platepar
	- X/Y, alt/az, ra/dec on mouse position
	- centroid with aperature
	- frame by frame
	- write out results in FTPdetectinfo


- Generate doc page



Things to resolve before 1.0 release:
-------------------------------------

- Cleaning code for multiplatform use (ie. os.sep, abstracting away hardware interface layer)

- .deb installer & storing everything on usual locations (/var/log, /usr/local/bin, /opt...)

- Windows installer & storing everything in usual Win dirs (C:/Program Files/...)



DONE:
-----

- Add check if camera is open before capture

- Option for non-interlaced video (deinterlace_flag=-1)
