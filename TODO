add detection log
add error log

post-detection:
	star extraction
	astrometry
	photometry

new multiprocessing:
	capture keeps own process (higest priorty)
	spawn new process for each new 256 frame block (high priorty):
		do both compression and fireball extraction successively, in same process
	detection runs on available cores, pausing on high load (lowest priorty)

improve logging
clean ALL docstrings
add module docstrings and docopt argument parser to all modules that are called from terminal
generate doc page

cleaning daemon:
	moves all processed compressed images to backup storage
	clean compressed images without detection after X time
	clean compressed images with detection when on low storage
