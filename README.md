# RPi Meteor Station

Open source powered meteor station. We are currently using the Raspberry Pi 2 as the main development platform.
The software is still deep in the development phase, but here are its current features:

1. Video capturing from a sensitive B/W video camera
2. Compressing 256-frame blocks into the Four-frame Temporal Pixel (FTP) format
3. Detecting bright fireballs in real time
4. Detecting meteors on FTP compressed files
5. Extracting stars from FTP compressed files
